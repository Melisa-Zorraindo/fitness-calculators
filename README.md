## Description

This is a web application that provides a set of useful fitness calculators to help users track their progress and achieve their fitness goals.

- **Calorie calculator:** This calculator helps users estimate the number of calories they need to consume each day to maintain their weight or reach their weight loss or weight gain goals. Users can enter their gender, age, height, weight, and activity level to get a personalised estimate. It also determines the optimal macronutrient (protein, carbohydrate, and fat) ratios for their fitness goals.
